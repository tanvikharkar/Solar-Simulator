# Solar-Simulator
In order to quickly and easily tune the solar simulator’s LED power intensity outputs, we created a computer-based control application using the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller via UART. For each individual LED color - for example, red, amber, UV, etc. - the user is able to enter any intensity from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%. These intensities correspond to an analog value that is then converted into a voltage which is outputted by the microcontroller to the pin corresponding to the LED color specified by the user. To specify the LED color, the user enters the first letter of the desired color - for example, ‘r’ for red, ‘a’ for amber, ‘u’ for UV, etc. - or the user can enter ‘e’ to set the same intensity for all the LEDs. Likewise, the user can also enter ‘s’ to set the LEDs to the adjusted spectrum, which we determined as the closest actual solar spectrum output capable of being produced by the solar simulator. The program is capable of checking for invalid inputs and will not perform any action until the user enters a valid input.
